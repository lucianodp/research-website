    * Surveyed the State-of-the-Art in Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning.
    * Designed and trained an adaptive traffic lights controller, capable of adapting the distribution of green time over different lanes with varying vehicle throughput. The controller was trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques and Neural Networks.
    * Our adaptive controller achieved a reduction of more than 25% on the average number of idle vehicles over fixed-time controllers.
